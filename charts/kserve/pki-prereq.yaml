# cert-manager PKI prerequisites for KServe
# These resources must be applied before installing the KServe chart.
# The default uses a self-signed CA for internal TLS between inference
# components. For production, replace opendatahub-selfsigned-issuer with
# a ClusterIssuer backed by your organization's CA (e.g., Vault, ACM PCA).
